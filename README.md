# GlorifiedCruiseControl V2

Version 2 is currently a work in progress

## Overview
A proof of concept autonomous driving system.<br/>
This process is know as [Behavioral Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01954). In this case the AI system is attempting to recreate the driving behavior observed in the data.<br/>
The the Neural Network model is adopted from NVIDIA where they use a Convolutional Neural Net to take video frames of the road and predict driving commands.<br/>

## TODO
* Clean up files, make things neat
* Objectify a lot of the codebase
* Migrate Deep Learning model to pytorch
* Build a web interface instead of using opencv
* Build a control interface to send messages to the car

## CONV Net Architecture
Using a convolutional architecture for predicting steering wheel commands from raw images worked the best. The architecture used was based on an [paper by NVIDIA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf).
